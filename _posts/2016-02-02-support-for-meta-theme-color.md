I have added the meta tag `theme-color` to this website and blog, and now Google chrome for android will give a color to the UI, making the website look modern, in a lollypop material look. This is really awesome!!

If you are wondering how to do this, it is fairly easy to do this on your blogs too, and all it takes is to add a meta tag to the head of your HTML template.

~~~ html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#2980b9">
~~~

And then it looks awesome like shown in the image. This is really cool. I heard that this will also work in iOS, but I do not have an iOS device to test, so if you happen to see this there, kindly tell me, I'd happy to see how that looks on your device.
