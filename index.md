My area of interests is very vast. I like to learn as many programming languages as I can, and I think I'm already good in programming in C, C++, C#, VB.Net, Java, Objective-C, Haxe, PHP and JavaScript. I will be trying out newer languages, and I'm currently trying to learn Rust programming language. I'm also looking forward to learn Ruby and Scala this year.

Aside from languages, I like programming graphics and I have taught myself OpenGL by reading 'The OpenGL Superbible' book. I'm also interested in Game Programming, and I have been trying to write my own game engine in Java. [SilenceEngine](https://github.com/sriharshachilakapati/SilenceEngine) is the result of my tries. And this year, I have also participated in LudumDare. I was able to submit my game, but it was unpolished. I have to spend more time on learning more as I said before.

After all this, I like writing tutorials. You can read them, and currently I'm writing a tutorial series on LWJGL 3. I'm also trying to make video series on YouTube on Jekyll, the software that powers this website. Apart from all these things, I like to spend chatting with my friends, and go on for a ride on the bike.

I'm a student of Computer Science in Sri Vasavi Engineering College, Tadepalligudem, India. Right now I'm studying 3<sup>rd</sup> year of the B.Tech programme.
